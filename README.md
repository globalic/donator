# Usage

## Requirements

- iOS 6.0+

## Instructions

- After creating an account or logging into the app, users simply need to swipe left or right to view the next charity.  Double-tapping on the current organization will give users more detailed information about the charity, as well as direct links to their websites.

## Next Steps

- As this is still a work-in-progress, I plan to incorporate in-app donation functionality soon that will allow users to quickly make small contributions to organizations they choose.  Users can keep track of their favorite organizations using the charts tab that diplays total donations by individual user or overall.

# Development

## The Technology

### Tech Stack

- **Objective-C**: native iOS development
- **Core Data**: Apple ORM
- **Core Plot**: plotting framework
- **Parse**: BaaS

### Dev Tools

- **git**: version control


## Challenges

- This app was my first venture into iOS development and as such, learning Objective-C within a short span proved to be the biggest bottleneck to progress.  After help from sites like [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com "iOS Tutorials") I managed to put together a simple prototype of what I envision to be a tool that helps facilitate charitable donations by minimizing the effort to do so.
